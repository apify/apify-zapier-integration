# Zapier Apify Integration

The Apify integration to Zapier allows you to connect Apify platform with 600+ app.

## Development

If you are interested in adding a new feature or fixing a bug in the integration, feel free to open a pull request.

### Tests

You will need your Apify API token before you run tests.
You can find the token [on the Integrations page of your Apify account](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations).
Run this command to test the app:
```text
TEST_USER_TOKEN=apify_api_token npm run test
```

### Release

New versions should be released using the [Zapier CLI](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-cli#promoting-an-app-version).
Only Apify team members can deploy new versions, and there is a [document in Notion on how to do it](https://www.notion.so/apify/Zapier-integration-f6f60d2a830b4bd79ffd2212d0c1566b).
